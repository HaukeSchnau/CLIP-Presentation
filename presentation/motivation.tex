    \frametitle{Issues with Traditional Image Classification using CNNs}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traditional image classification models are trained on large datasets of labeled images
              \pause
        \item \textbf{Costly dataset:} Requires lots of manually labeled data
              \pause
        \item \textbf{Narrow:} Each new task requires a new model to be trained from scratch or fine-tuned $\rightarrow$ Expensive!
    \end{itemize}

    \pause

    Can we do better without compromising on performance?

    \frametitle{Idea: Train model to \textit{understand} images}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instead of training on labeled images, train on images and their descriptions
        \item Model learns to associate images with their descriptions
        \item At inference time, predict the description of an image
    \end{itemize}

    \pause

    Key advantage: \textbf{Zero-shot learning} $\rightarrow$ Model can predict descriptions of image categories it has never seen before.
